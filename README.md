- from René: I came across an interesting topic today where Seismology meets gravitational wave physics. This is the particular paper I came across (but it's only the top of an iceberg):
A Seismological Study of the Sos EnattosArea—the Sardinia Candidate Site for theEinstein Telescope https://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/13943/4/2020_DiGiovanni_Sos.pdf.pdf
